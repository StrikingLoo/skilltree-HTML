# Skilltree

Using Vis.js, this is a skill tree creator.
- Create custom skill trees.
- Track your progress in a course or learning journey.
- Save a snapshot of your tree as a .png.

All the data is plaintext so you can version it or combine this tool into your workflow with no pain.

Feel free to extend this code, fork or do a PR if you have any interesting improvements to suggest. I am also receiving feedback on future features.

A nicer UI is available on [my website](https://strikingloo.github.io/skilltree).
